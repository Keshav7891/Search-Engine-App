# File Seach App

0) Simple python application which is used to implement search feature similar to windows
1) This project uses the os.walk() function to index the file directory, and the PySimpleGUI package to build a very nice looking user interface for the application.
2) It offers three types of searches 'Contains' , 'Starts With' , 'Ends With'.
3) Re-index saves a local copy of the index for quick re-use. This makes subsequent searches nearly instant.
4) Search results are both printed to screen and exported to a text file in the working directory.
